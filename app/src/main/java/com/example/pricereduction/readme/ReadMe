Possible Improvements(with time/scope):
*More unit and instrumented tests
*Reading from a cached response to form a live DTO for search and detail responses instead of mocking
*Repository pattern with a db to cache search results
*Recently searched suggestions for search view
*Shared element transitions from Home -> Details
*Interceptors for Retrofit to add universal parameters
*Creating models to be used in the UI layer instead of reusing DTOs
*Better error management
*A UI hint for the users to search for something when the list is empty/app is started fresh
*Better landscape support
*Providing back navigation via toolbar in AlbumDetailsActivity
